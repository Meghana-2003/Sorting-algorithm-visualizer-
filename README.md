# Sorting-algorithm-visualizer-
Sorting Visualizer is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms Like

1. Selection Sort.
2. Bubble Sort.
3. Insertion Sort.
4. Merge Sort.
5. Quick Sort.
With the functionality of ⏳(Processing Speed Control) and 📏(Array Size Control)

##How it Works
_Here in our model, each element value is represented by THE SIZE OF THE BAR and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right

_The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.
