# How it Works?!
_Here in our model, each element value is represented by THE SIZE OF THE BAR and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right.

_The algorithms move the items around by swapping elements, Without using any additional memory to create another array.
